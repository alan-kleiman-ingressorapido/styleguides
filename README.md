# Style Guides

This repository contains a set of style guides, coding conventions and
standards for the languages I care about.

## Purpose

I am sick of putting this stuff up for a vote every new team I create or
start up. It consumes less time if we just for a set of conventions and
standards that I am already happy with and iterate on that for the teams
needs.

There will be a `master` branch which will contain the coding styles,
conventions and standards that I personally prefer. The `develop` branch
may contain some tweaks I am playing with and haven't decided upon yet.

Other branches will be the living standard for the team, OSS project,
etc. that I am an active participant in that doesn't mind this being
public.

Anyone is allowed to fork this repository and update the style guides
for their own purposes and teams use.

A lot of this I don't really have strong opinions on (unless otherwise
mentioned) the key is consistency of a codebase's style and conventions
in a team setting with many people contributing. It reduces the maintenance
costs of codebases if there is a shared understanding of standards and
conventions that should be adhered to.

These should be enforced during review.
